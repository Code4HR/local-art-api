In lower Norfolk County fifty acres of land at the entrance of the eastern branch of the Elizabeth River were purchased from Nicholas Wise, thus assuring the town of good water access to the surrounding areas. County surveyor John FerebEe, laid out Front Street (now Main Street) on high ground and the town was divided into half-acre sites for dwelling houses and warehouses. \r\n\r\nThe original town was almost completely surrounded by water. Access by land was limited to a single road which later became Church Street (now Lower St. Paul’s Boulevard). The town covered what is now the southern portion of downtown Norfolk. Bounded generally by the river on the south and west, City Hall Avenue on the north and Interstate 264 on the East. The Cannons displayed here were unearthed in 1982 from Otter Berth and Town Point Park. They are of Revolutionary War vintage and are of unknown origin. The carriages were constructed of white oak to 18th century specifications by members of the Norfolk Rotary Club.”"

            "description":"Town point is where norfolk began, in 1860 the general assembly of his majesty’s colony of virginia enacted a law requiring each county to establish and develop a town site. In lower norfolk county fifty acres of land at the entrance of the eastern branch of the elizabeth river were purchased from nicholas wise, thus assuring the town of good water access to the surrounding areas. County surveyor john ferebee, laid out front street (now main street) on high ground and the town was divided into half-acre sites for dwelling houses and warehouses. The original town was almost completely surrounded by water. Access by land was limited to a single road which later became church street (now lower st. Paul’s boulevard). The town covered what is now the southern portion of downtown norfolk. Bounded generally by the river on the south and west, city hall avenue on the north and interstate 264 on the east. The cannons displayed here were unearthed in 1982 from otter berth and Town Point Park. They are of revolutionary war vintage and are of unknown origin. The carriages were constructed of white oak to 18th century specifications by members of the Norfolk Rotary Club."

Fuller, Norfolk’s first African-American councilman established the West Point section of the Elmwood Cemetery as a burial ground for Norfolk’s African-American citizens. The Civil War soldier depicted on the West Point Monument is Norfolk native Sergeant William H. Carney of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment. Carney’s parents were born slaves, but secured their freedom and left Norfolk with their son for New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1855. Carney enlisted in the 54th Massachusetts in 1862 and fought with his regiment during the July 18, 1863 attack on Fort Wagner, South Carolina.\r\n\r\n When the color bearers were shot down I failed assault, Carney, despite being severely wounded, managed to save the U.S. flag from capture. “When they saw me bring in the colors,” Carney recollected, “they cheered me, and I was able to tell them that the old flag never touched the ground.” Carney was awarded the Medal of Honor for his extraordinary bravery under fire. He was the first of sixteen African American soldiers to receive the Medal of Honor during the Civil War. Sgt. Carney’s stone figure solemnly stands today as a tribute to the 100 African American veterans at rest in West Point Cemetery. This bronze sculpture sits atop a granite obelisk atop a concrete base with bronze plaques."

In 1949, the sculptures changed hands again, this time to an antique dealer in Richmond, Virginia. Next, Bruce Dunstan acquired six of the statues for his Richmond estate, Broadview. Four of the other statues were purchased by another Richmonder, Vincent Speranza. The remaining statue of Thomas Crawford became property of the Virginia Museum of Fine Art. In 1963, Dunstan donated his six statues to the Norfolk Botanical Garden. Through the efforts of Col.

The sculptures first became the property of Evelyn Walsh, a Washington, D.C. socialite who owned Friendship Estate. Walsh arranged the statues around her swimming pool. In 1949, the sculptures changed hands again, this time to an antique dealer in Richmond, Virginia. Next, Bruce Dunstan acquired six of the statues for his Richmond estate, Broadview. Four of the other statues were purchased by another Richmonder, Vincent Speranza. The remaining statue of Thomas Crawford became property of the Virginia Museum of Fine Art.\r\n\r\nIn 1963, Dunstan donated his six statues to the Norfolk Botanical Garden.\r\n\r\nThrough the efforts of Col.

            "description":"Framed appropriately against the classical architecture of the Chrysler Museum of Art, the heroic Torch Bearers symbolizes the endurance of Enlightenment ideals and the effort required for their preservation. One of Anna Hyatt Huntington's most ambitious multi–figure works, The Torch Bearers's bravura, idealism, and towering scale are characteristic of her major public sculptures. Over almost seven decades of active production, Huntington's animal groups and equestrian monuments increasingly ran counter to developments in twentieth–century American art, but her remarkable early success and later marriage to a wealthy philanthropist and museum benefactor guaranteed her independence. Anna Vaughn Hyatt, the daughter of a Harvard paleontologist, held her first one–artist show in 1901, exhibiting fifty animal sculptures at the Boston Art Club. Two years later she moved to New York, where she studied with classically trained sculptors Hermon Atkins MacNeil, George Gray Barnard, and Gutzon Borglum; in 1904 she won a medal at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. For the rest of her life, her sculpture–naturalistic animals and human figures, often in a classical context–was consistent with the aesthetics of the American Renaissance. By the early 1920s Hyatt had won awards and prestigious commissions on both sides of the Atlantic and was one of the highest–paid women in the United States. In 1923 she married the poet and philanthropist Archer M. Huntington; the results of their partnership are still visible on America's cultural landscape. One of their most impressive collaborations is the cultural center at Audubon Terrace in upper Manhattan, a complex of museums that Archer developed from 1908 to the 1930s. There, Anna's monuments to El Cid, Don Quixote, and other Spanish heroes (as well as several of her animal groups) are framed by the impeccable Beaux–Arts classicism of architects Stanford White and Cass Gilbert.\r\n\r\nThe first cast of The Torch Bearers was an April 1955 gift to the University of Madrid; Archer Huntington wrote a poem by the same title that was inscribed on its base. That was the couple\\\r\nOne year later, Anna offered another cast, then partially complete, to the city of Norfolk, to be installed in the plaza facing the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences (now the Chrysler Museum of Art).\r\n\r\nFour other versions are in museum and university collections in the United States and Cuba. In her letter offering The Torch Bearers to Norfolk, Anna Hyatt Huntington cited her husband\\'s long affiliation with Hampton Roads. Archer\\'s father, Collis P. Huntington, founded the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company; a few miles away, Archer established the Mariners\\' Museum in 1930. In the large park surrounding the Mariners\\' Museum are more of Anna\\'s sculptures, including pairs of lions framing a dramatic view of the James River and another idealistic equestrian work, Conquering the Wild, ca. 1927.'s final collaboration, as he died in December."
